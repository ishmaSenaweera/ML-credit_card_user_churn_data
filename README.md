# ML-credit_card_user_churn_data

This project aims to predict whether a credit card customer will churn or not using the bank service. To train the model, four distinct supervised learning algorithms were 
applied to the dataset to find the best-performing algorithm. 

The algorithms applied are,
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Support Vector Machines.
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Random Forest
